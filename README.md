OSCampus
=========

This is the video LMS that we use at OSTraining.com. It's live on OSTraining, but it's still a work in progres.


## Limited Support Scope
We've open sourced it under the GPL license so that others can use it as an LMS for their project. We welcome any feedback, bug reports, and code contributions. However, at this time, we're focusing on features that are needed for our users at OSTraining, so support is limited.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3+
* MySQL 5.0.3+
* Joomla! 2.5, 3.2+
